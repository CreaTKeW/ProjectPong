# ProjectPong

ProjectPong is a classic Pong game where you control the left paddle and compete against an AI-controlled opponent. The objective is to hit the ball past the enemy paddle and into the field behind it to score points.

## Gameplay

The game features two paddles: one controlled by the player (left paddle) and the other controlled by the AI (right paddle). The player's paddle can be moved using the following keyboard controls:

- Move the left paddle up: W key
- Move the left paddle down: S key

The AI-controlled right paddle automatically follows the movement of the ball.

To score points, hit the ball past the enemy paddle and into the field behind it. The game continues until one player reaches a score of 5 points. Once a player scores 5 points, the game ends, and the winner is declared.

## Pausing the Game
